# Stylish: the front-end theming laboratory 

Frameworks such as Semantic-UI, Bootstrap, Foundation, or others,
provide a great starting point for responsive, decent looking websites.
There are plenty of off the shelf themes one can purchase as well, but
in my experience working with many of them they start to fall apart when
you try to decompose them into re-usable components in your own front
end architecture, or turn them into templates to be rendered in a Rails
app for example.

Stylish is a set of tools aimed toward front end developers who are
developing custom themes, components, or widgets using popular CSS Frameworks as their base. 
It helps you design, develop, distribute, maintain, update, and sell these themes.

Stylish helps theme developers organize their work in such a way that
makes their themes and example pages extremely easy to incorporate into
the many different development frameworks which will attempt to break 
them apart and use them.
